This directory contains OChemDoc examples for the discussion. 
This only for Peter and Michael, so don't bother us. 

ochemdoc.xsl   is a mockup that transforms to html until an OMDoc-style
               transformation process comes along
schemas.xsl    tell nxml-mode on emacs which schema to take
ochemdoc.rnc   is the first RelaxNG schema (for authoring sanity)
