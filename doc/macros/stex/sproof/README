sproof.sty: An Infrastructure for Structural Markup for Proofs

This package supplies macros and environment that allow to annotate the structure of
mathematical proofs. This structure can be used by MKM systems for added-value services,
either directly from the sTeX sources, or after translation via the LaTeXML system.
