cnx.cls: A LaTeX-based Syntax for Connexions Modules

The cnx class is a collection of TeX macros that allow to write Connexions modules in the
CNXLaTeX format without leaving the LaTeX workflow. Modules are authored using cnx.cls
using only a text editor, transformed to PDF and proofread as usual.  For publication,
CNXLaTeX modules are transformed to CNXML via the LaTeXML translator and can be uploaded
to the Connexions system.
