%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% The LaTeX2CNX conversion project in sTeX: %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The idea is to convert pre-loaded (i.e. written in a controlled subset we call CNXLaTeX)
LaTeX to CNXML via Bruce Millers LaTeXML converter (http://dlmf.nist.gov/LaTeXML). 

This directory holds the project files. 

Manifest:
=========

ex.tex               is a very early example it is largely obsolete by now. 

cmathml-module.tex   suppplies semantic macros for MathML bindings

m0039.tex            is a CNXLaTeX version of a simple CNXML module 
s0039.tex            is the semantic counterpart of it. 

xsl (subdir)         contains the XSLT that is necessary to massage the latexmlpost output
                     into correct CNXML.

Makefile	     automates the conversion process

Dependencies:
=============
../sty/cnx.cls       the LaTeX class for the LaTeX bindings for CNXML
../sty/cnx.ltxml     the LaTeXML bindings for it. 
../LaTeXML	     the local copy of the LaTeXML distribution (sometimes patched)
../dtd/cnxml.dtd     a hand-build mockup of the CNXML DTD; hopefully obsolete
../dtd/cnxml_LaTeXML an extension of the CNXML DTD by LaTeXML stuff for intermediate 
                     conversion steps.
