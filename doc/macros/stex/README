sTeX: An Infrastructure for Semantic Preloading of LaTeX Documents

This directory contains the sTeX package collection, a version of TeX/LaTeX that allows
to markup TeX/LaTeX documents semantically without leaving the document format,
essentially turning it into a document format for mathematical knowledge management
(MKM).
